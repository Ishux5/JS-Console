Open and load your entire YouTube-Playlist by scrolling all the way to the bottom of your playlist.
Open your console by pressing either (a) F12 (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and navigate to the console Menu or (b) Ctrl+Shift+J (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), Shift + âŒ˜ + J (mac)
Paste all of the Code into the Console and press ENTER
The console will return the total time of the listed Videos
